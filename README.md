# Data-Mart-Project
This was a group project I  completed during my cloud data certification. We used SQL, unix scripting, Informatica, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift and Tableau to complete this project. 

I was responsible for the following:
> GA_DataMart_Architecture_Diagram_v4.pdf,
> GA_Dimension_Model-xlsx,
> GA_UNIX_SCRIPTS_FACT_DIMENSION_TABLES,
> GA_UNIX_SCRIPTS_STAGING_TABLES,
> GA_Testing_Document.xlsx

In the end we had a working datamart in Redshift and were able to archive copies of the fact and dimenson tables in S3.
