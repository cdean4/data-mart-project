# Data-Mart-Project
This was a group project I  completed during my cloud data certification. We needed to take 6 csv files, complete some data cleaning and then create fact and dimension tables to load into a datamart on the cloud. We used SQL, unix scripting, Informatica, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift and Tableau to complete this project. 

I was responsible for the following documents and scripts: <br>
> - GA_DataMart_Architecture_Diagram_v4.pdf <br>
> - GA_Dimension_Model-xlsx <br>
> - GA_UNIX_SCRIPTS_FACT_DIMENSION_TABLES <br>
> - GA_UNIX_SCRIPTS_STAGING_TABLES <br>
> - GA_Testing_Document.xlsx

We started out with six flat files and in the end we had a working datamart with 1 fact table and 4 dimension tables in Redshift. We archived copies of the fact and dimenson tables in S3.
