# Data-Mart-Project
This was a group project I  completed during my cloud data certification. We needed to take six csv files, complete some data cleaning and then create fact and dimension tables to load into a datamart on the cloud. We also created some reports from the final data in the datamart for BI. We used SQL, unix scripting, Informatica, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift and Tableau to complete this project. 

I was responsible for creating the following documents and scripts: <br>
> - GA_DataMart_Architecture_Diagram_v4.pdf <br>
> - GA_Dimension_Model-xlsx <br>
> - GA_UNIX_SCRIPTS_FACT_DIMENSION_TABLES <br>
> - GA_UNIX_SCRIPTS_STAGING_TABLES <br>
> - GA_Testing_Document.xlsx
